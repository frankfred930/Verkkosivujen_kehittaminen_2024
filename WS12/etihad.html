                  <p class="card-text">The Etihad Stadium, originally known as the City of Manchester Stadium, is one of the most iconic football venues in England.

                  <p class="card-text">After the Games, the stadium was redeveloped for use by Manchester City Football Club, which moved in shortly after the Games concluded. This transformation, involving a major overhaul of the facilities and stands, turned it into a modern football stadium. Over the years, the Etihad Stadium has undergone several expansions and upgrades to increase capacity and improve the fan experience.
